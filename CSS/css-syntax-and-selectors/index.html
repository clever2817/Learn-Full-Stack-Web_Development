    <h1>CSS Syntax and Selectors</h1>

    <p>There are three ways to add CSS. These are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li style="color: darkslategray; font-size: 20px;">Inline CSS (It has the most precedence but not recommended to use.)</li>

        <li>Internal CSS (It has the second most precedence but still not recommended to use.)</li>

        <li>External CSS(It has the least precedence but it is highly recommended to use because of its cleanliness and reuse ability.)</li>
    </ul>
